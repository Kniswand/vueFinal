# vueFinal

See the src folder, "App.vue" and "index.html" files above

Web4 link App: https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/~kniswand/vueFinal/vueFinal/src/App.vue

I can't get the Web4 link to go to the index, so instead it goes to the App.vue code. It seems to work fine otherwise on my one computer.
